# Conversational AI App with FastAPI and OpenAI

This application demonstrates a web service using FastAPI to interact with OpenAI's APIs for audio transcription, text generation, and text-to-speech capabilities. Users can upload audio files, transcribe them, generate responses using OpenAI's chat model, convert those responses to speech, and stream the resulting audio back to the user.

## Features

- **Audio Transcription:** Upload an audio file, transcribe it to text using OpenAI's transcription API.
- **Conversational AI:** Use OpenAI's chat API to generate responses based on user input.
- **Text-to-Speech Conversion:** Convert AI-generated text responses to speech using OpenAI's TTS API.
- **Streaming Audio Response:** Stream the generated speech audio back to the user.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- OpenAI API key (sign up at [OpenAI](https://www.openai.com/) if you don't have one)
